# Arduino Digital Photoframe

This is the project I've used for the TV in the Rita's Dolls House.
Project is for an Arduino UNO (or Duemilanove?) with a shield 2.4 TFT LCD 240x320 pixels + microSD card reader. Arduino Leonardo and other Arduino models are not suitable!

**Warning**: display I've linked has no Touch Screen, some examples in the directory requires touch screen. For a simple Photoframe, touch screen is not needed
