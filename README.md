# Arduino Digital Photoframe

This is the project I've used for the TV in the Rita's Dolls House.

Project is for an Arduino UNO (or Duemilanove?) with a shield 2.4 TFT LCD 240x320 pixels + microSD card reader
(such like this: http://www.ebay.it/itm/2-4-TFT-LCD-Visualizzazione-panel-SD-carta-240x320-Arduino-Elettronica-Shield-/331769583790?hash=item4d3f0218ae:g:48oAAOSwJb9Ws3rI)

Arduino Leonardo and other Arduino models are not suitable!
